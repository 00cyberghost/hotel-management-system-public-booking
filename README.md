This is the public booking view of a hotel management system built with next.js. This is a bought html/bootstrap template which i have edited to suit my purpose and the pages converted to react components. The template have been edited and positioned to consume the necessary APIs that will be coming from my laravel backend. Generally the work is about 70% done as further editing is required and images needs to be optimized

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

I personally plan to deploy this a static file on a hosting. You can run this npm command "npm run build" to generate the static build file which can be deployed on any shared hosting platform
